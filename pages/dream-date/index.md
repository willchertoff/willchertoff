Not another dating app.

Dream Date is a web app designed for Oregon Museum of Science and Industry's "OMSI After Dark: Love and Sex" event on February 13, 2016.

The app functions as a location based audio story, guiding museum patrons towards different exhibits while telling them a fictional story. Think 'book on tape' meets 2016.

My goal with Dream Date was to provide users with a warm, welcoming experience. One that they could instantly fall into without much thought.

Guide users. Don't give them a million options.

3 screens. Onboarding, Map, Transcript. Subtle but elegant. Modern but Nostalgic. You can find the app here.
