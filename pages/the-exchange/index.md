Get out sometimes. There is a lot to see.

The Exchange is an agreement. The Exchange is a language. The Exchange is a system where words have become currency.

The Exchange is a modern story app that advances as you visit pertinent Portland locations and listen to the story unfold. Rapidly gain favor with a media mogul, assist a pair of con-men in building a revolutionary machine, and join a jazz band as the Tourist, a transplant in a new city.

Although the story is told primarily through audio soundbites, characters also send you text, audio, and location messages, and you can accept or decline paths in a choose-your-adventure style. Check out the app on the app store.
